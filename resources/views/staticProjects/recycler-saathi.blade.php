                                                <p>The waste management sector of Nepal is still not in a good structure. The sector has been largely side-lined and the players involved in the field have not received the attention that they require in terms of enhancing their work as their sustaining their livelihoods. This has directly or indirectly taken a toll on the general scenario of the waste management sector and resulted in its slow progress.  </p>

                                                <p>Livelihood Enhancement Program has been introduced by Recycler Saathi to cater to the socio- economic needs of the waste workers as well as other stakeholders. It works in close collaboration with multiple stakeholders and ensures they attain a stable livelihood along with the skills required to enhance their work performance. Our Livelihood Enhancement Programs extends from waste collectors to our balers  </p>

                                                <p>By screening the needs of waste collectors and balers, we carefully plan and customise various activities for them. As part of our intervention to ensure good health of our waste workers, we have organized health camps in the past years along with health awareness sessions. Further, to enhance the working efficiency of our balers, capacity building trainings for them have been organized frequently. </p>

                                                <p>We have multiple stakeholders in the waste management sector who have been making efforts as per their capacity to enhance the mechanism. However, these scattered efforts have not been much instrumental to develop a proper recycling mechanism within the country. The need of the hour is not just to build a strong network of waste management players who can contribute their part from their side but also streamline it into an organized collective effort to recycle as much waste as we can, reducing our carbon footprint and bring sustainable change in the waste management sector.   </p>

                                                <h4>The Intervention</h4>
                                                <p>Through expansion of our existing network and collaboration with new partners, Recycler Saathi aims to eliminate this loophole of scattered efforts. It believes that it cannot work in isolation to tackle the problem of waste management and achieve the intended recovery numbers of waste PET bottles with individual effort. Hence, Recycler Saathi already has a network of different stakeholders that provide us with waste PET bottles as well as assist us with enhancing the waste management mechanism. The stakeholders involved range from waste collectors to local government.  </p>

                                                <h4>The Process</h4>
                                                <p>Our partners and stakeholders are in different capacities and have different roles. The partnership role is divided on the basis of contribution expected from them. Balers can partner with Recycler Saathi to provide their collection of waste PET bottles. Similarly, waste management organisations are welcome to join the network and collaborate with us to advocate for policy level changes. Educational institutions can join the network and allow space for their young students to learn and internalize the essence of environment conservation and recycling.   </p>

There is need for awareness among a larger mass of people, which we tend to lack. Especially the engagement of young students and children in actions for environment conservation is minimal and needs to be expanded. Without ground level realization from the community itself, no substantial change can be implemented. Further, policy level support which is imperative to inculcate and institutionalise any change is highly lacking in Nepal is terms of waste management.     </p>

It believes in harnessing the power and enthusiasm of the young minds to bring change and influence the community that they live in and eventually attract greater momentum to the cause of recycling. Further, other stakeholders through partnerships are also engaged in the process of outreach and advocacy.   </p>

Similarly, youth have been engaged in the process through various voluntary activities. Recycler Saathi has also engaged the various groups of community through both physical and digital mediums. Through physical medium, it organizes and partakes in rallies, talk shows and stakeholders meeting. From digital platforms, it ensures awareness and engagement through PSAs, informative videos and posts.     </p>
