                                                <p>The 2015 Nepal Earthquake uprooted many lives. Many died and many were left without any means to survive- their lands and houses were all destroyed by the earthquake and its aftershocks. Children were vulnerable due to consequences created by the destruction and their future was at stakes. 32000 classrooms were destroyed and 15352 of them were damaged. This presented a bleak future for children and put a question mark on their education. Not just students, but the general lives of many were shattered with no shelter and scattering of communities that they relied on. Social cohesion of communities was shattered and the road to normalcy seemed like a battle. </p>

                                                <h4>The Intervention</h4>
                                                <p>Rebuild for Change (RFC) was introduced to cater to the destructions caused by the earthquake. It is a compassion- based community regrowth initiative undertaken to help communities build back their lives. The other motive behind the initiation of the project was to channelise the relief funds for the right purpose and to the right beneficiaries.    </p>

Through the project, the inculcation of local ethos and technology has always been the topmost priority which can be seen through its projects Padhero and Model Village of Burunchuli. Similarly, vulnerable schools in areas affected by the earthquake were also identified and a project titled RFC Schools was initiated to rebuild schools and classrooms.   </p>

A total of nine RFC Schools in different districts were built to ensure students are not refrained from their right to education. The schools were rebuilt in Dhading, Sindhupalchowk, Sindhuli, Saptari, Nuwakot and Lalitpur    </p>

Reports suggest that since 1990 more than 10000 casualties have occurred every year in the six districts- Dhading, Makwanpur, Rautahat, Sarlahi, Sindhuli and Chitwan. The intensity of disasters especially in the Terai region only seems to be aggravating. Despite the repetition of the same pattern every year, the efforts to prevent this mishap is very bleak.   </p>

It is an alliance of youth clubs, vloggers, students, disaster experts, ex-armies and volunteers and serves as a common platform for those who want to help the affected communities. It was created under the leadership of CREASION and served as a reliable platform to dispatch help when needed for flood- affected communities.   </p>

                                                <p>Alliance for Disaster Relief is a reliable platform to collect in-kind donations from different interested donors and business enterprises and disseminate them to the neediest communities affected by flood. During the 2017 flood, CREASION’s head office served as the main centre of communication where real time information on the disaster- hit area were effectively collected from Nepal Police and the local people. Birgunj was the main logistic hub where the materials were transported to various affected areas. Every year as in the 2017 flood, CREASION steps on the front line and acts as a bridge to dispatch relief for disaster affected communities.    </p>

                                                <p>The COVID-19 outbreak has dismantled sense of normalcy from the world. Our lives have been toppled and the economy, environment, society is at its lowest. Amidst this crisis, many groups of people have a struggle earning their daily livelihood. Waste workers are one such community of people who still need to work in the front line despite the threat of the virus but whose contributions have not been well recognized. They still face stigma attached to their profession as well as struggle to sustain their livelihood in the wake of COVID-19.     </p>

                                                <h4>The Intervention</h4>
                                                <p>The Waste Workers Emergency Relief Project (WWERP) was introduced in response to the challenges faced by waste workers due to COVID-19. It is an initiative for waste workers to ease their livelihood and ensure their safety while at work. The plan of action of the project involved provision of ration materials, awareness sessions, safety gears and free medical consultations to waste workers and their families so their survival was easy and without risk even when their profession demanded them to be on the ground despite the risks of the virus.     </p>

                                                <h4>The Process</h4>
                                                <p>The waste workers of Kathmandu, Lalitpur, Bhaktapur, Chitwan, Parsa, Sarlahi and Saptari were reached out through WWERP. The list of waste workers who would receive the assistance was curated with the help of our consortium partners- Doko Recyclers, NEPSEMYAK, Khaalisisi, Blue Waste to Value and Recycler Saathi. As per the plan and by following the rules of social distancing they were provided with the assistance materials and awareness sessions. The waste workers who were stationed at hospitals were given special priority and provided with awareness sessions on proper hospital waste management.     </p>
