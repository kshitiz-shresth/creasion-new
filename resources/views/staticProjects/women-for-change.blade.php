                                                <p>The status of women in our society is still at the bottom. Violence and discrimination centred around women is still very rampant and has affected many lives. Deep- rooted patriarchy has escalated unfavourable situation for women and paralyzed their growth as well as jeopardized their rights as a human. This has created a massive gender disparity and also refrained women from opportunities that could possible better their future.     </p>

It is a resort cum hotel management centre in Burunchuli that will operate as an economic centre all the while providing a means to earn livelihood for women and enhance their status.    </p>

The project will integrate lesser privileged and marginalized women in the process, train them in hotel management skills and then provide them employment in the resort.

This limits the potential of women and also impacts their self- esteem, confidence and pushes their status back in the society. Their domestic work is only taken as a mere form of unpaid labour and their hard work is not appreciated enough. Simply because their work is not equated to mere sums of money, their worth in the society is not taken to be very high. This has only aggravated the discrimination that they face and also constrained their capacity.   </p>
