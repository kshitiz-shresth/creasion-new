                                                <p>In 2017/18, the unemployment rate among youth was found to be 21.4% which was 10% more than the national average of 11.4%.  Despite 5.6 million youth population between 15-24 years, 2 million were not in employment, education or training. The statistics indicate a major lag between the human resource present in Nepal and our inability to engage them in a better way. CREASION identifies the serious lack of exposure to and change of job opportunities among young citizens in general. To address this need, Empower+ was launched.    </p>

Through Empower+, VFC hosts a series of trainings, workshops and hand-on sessions for students to help them learn skills that complements their college education. We aim to be able to provide youth with the right mentorship and trainings that will be instrumental for them to create a future that they desire.   </p>

The standard Empower+ training sessions consist of CV and Cover Letter Writing, Report Writing, Microsoft Office Package, Interview Tips and Techniques and Email Etiquette. The trainings sessions are also accompanied by experience sharing by professionals along with personality development class by experts. The sessions are customised according the to the need, request and proficiency of the students on the selected programs.</p>

                                                <p>The society tends to form stereotypes, internalize them and inject them in the minds and hearts of people. When the society presents us with an idea or opinion about certain issues, rarely do we question it and tend to go along with the original perspective. This has created a lot of misconceptions on important issues and directly and indirectly also influenced our actions- often invoking a negative impact.  Recognizing the prevalence of so many misinterpreted issues, CREASION launched Debunking Myths.  </p>

It is a series devoted towards bringing light into the myths that have been ingrained in our society and influenced our way of life and perceptions. It carefully chooses themes that have the ability to strike a conversation about misplaced issues and topics and debunk age-old myths that have dictated our lives and choices.       </p>

If the themes pique the interest of the audience then we also conduct follow- up events to let our audience have a clear picture of the issue at hand.   </p>

                                                <p>The role of waste workers is often undermined in our society considering the nature of their profession. However, without their presence and their contribution, the environment and the society would fail to be in balance. It is important to recognize the contribution of our waste workers and provide them with respect and assistance. The perpetual injustice and lack of attention to their well- being is unfair to them as well as a risk for the environment and society. Hence, Hamro Cycle Yatra was launched as a means to acknowledge and show respect to the contributions of waste workers.    </p>

The initiation of IVP has welcomed volunteers from all over the world in an attempt to narrow the gap between the Nepali and international community. The volunteers are responsible to assist the local communities in different development intervention with the skills and knowledge that they have while keeping the ethos and cultural values of the communities alive and respected.       </p>

As volunteers, one can choose to work on different ongoing projects. Generally, international volunteers are included in projects located in remote areas of Nepal so that they can attain a glimpse of the local culture and traditions of Nepal. </p>

                                                <p>Internship opportunities are provided to our volunteers according to their interest. Similarly, we make sure our IVP volunteers are exposed to culture and traditions that exist in Nepal.  </p>

Our concept of development is generally defined by high- rise buildings and high economic growth and in the midst of it, we have been jeopardizing the natural resources present around us and undermining their importance. Development cannot attain its true essence until and unless we find a balance between the economic and natural environment.     </p>

                                                <p>Tree of the Year Nepal was introduced as an initiative to make people realize the importance of biodiversity and the natural environment. It is an extension of the Asian Tree of the Year  organized by Carbon Consulting Company (CCC), South Asia’s foremost provider in integrated sustainability services. Tree of the Year Nepal is affiliated to the Asian Tree of the Year and is a national contest that focuses on starting a conversation amongst the citizens on the importance of protecting trees and the importance to preserve biodiversity. As Nepal stands in the cross- roads of development, the contest aims to provide a clarity to the citizens on what should be prioritised in the path to achieving sustainable development.        </p>

                                                <p>Tree of the Year Nepal is basically a photography contest that welcomes photo entries of trees that have special histories. The photograph entries must be accompanied by a story pertaining to why the tree is of special significance. The judges evaluate the winners on the basis of not just the quality of the photograph but also on the basis of the significance of the tree and the entrant's portrayal of it to instigate the need to conserve biodiversity present around us.     </p>
