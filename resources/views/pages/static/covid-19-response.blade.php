                                At every crisis, CREASION has always come at the forefront to provide assistance to the affected. The COVID-19 global pandemic and its consequences has uprooted the lives of many including waste workers.
                                CREASION acknowledges the hardships and contributions of waste workers and has initiated the Waste Workers Emergency Relief Project (WWERP) in support of The Coca-Cola Foundation.

                                The WWERP has partnered with different waste management organisations to reach out to more waste workers. Through ration packages, safety gears and awareness, the project aims to ensure the safety and
                                well-being of waste workers affected by the ongoing pandemic and the lockdown.

                                <p>
                                I have been working in the waste management sector since the last 14 years but the situation brought by the COVID-19 pandemic was a first-of-its kind.
                                 There was a lot of fear over the safety of waste workers like me and it was hard to continue with our job due to the lack of safety gears.

                                </p>

                                <p class="more-text">
                                I was even tested COVID-19 positive but thankfully I recovered well. I have become more conscious of my safety ever since.
                                  The help provided today in the form of safety gears has made me a little relieved about my health.
                                I hope to diligently make use of these protective equipment to protect myself from the danger of COVID-19 while ensuring I perform to the best at work.

                                There is obviously the fear of the virus, especially since I work in waste management. I fear for my family’s safety more than my own since a little
                                 carelessness at work and in my hygiene from my side means my family will be at risk. However, I have no choice but to come to work since my husband’s
                                 job has been affected due to the lockdown and I am the sole breadwinner of my family at the moment.

                                </p>

                                <p class="more-text">
                                    But I give strict attention to my hygiene after work and make sure to only enter my house and meet my family after I thoroughly wash my hands and change my work clothes. This has become the new normal for me but I am at least content that I have my job intact to sustain my family
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                I have been continuing with my work although the working frequency has declined due to restricted vehicle mobility. This has affected my income but I am happy to continue my work because it is the only means to sustain my family and also I see it as my duty towards the community.
                                </p>

                                I am not scared of the risks that entail in my profession because I take the required safety precautions.
                                    But what makes me the most insecure about working as a sanitation worker is the stigma attached to the profession and how society views us. I keep our community clean but the community members do not perceive my work well and see me as a possible threat due to my exposure to waste.
                                    I wish people would respect us and our profession and acknowledge the contribution that we make to the environment and the community- despite multiple health risks and the threat of the ongoing pandemic.
